Face Recognition System
Overview
A machine learning-based face recognition system capable of identifying and verifying individuals in images.


Features
- Face Detection: Detects faces in images.
- Face Recognition: Recognizes faces using CNN model.

In this you get the model in 3 dataset splitting 
- main[70]30 is the dataset splitting of 70-30
- main[80]20 is the dataset splitting of 80-20
- main[90]10 is the dataset splitting of 90-10

and at last in this a testing where i have tested this model 
-face recognition testing is the main testing code
